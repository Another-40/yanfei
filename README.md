Wishes (Banners) are the gacha system in Genshin Impact. There are two main types of wishes: the permanent standard wish -- Wanderlust Invocation and limited Event Wishes for characters and weapons.

The bot shows all the gacha banners in Genshin Impact, including past (does not include CBT banners), current and upcoming banners.
The details of the upcoming banners are still unknown. However, the promotional weapons/characters are confirmed, therefore they will not be on the gacha listing page until the details have been confirmed.
